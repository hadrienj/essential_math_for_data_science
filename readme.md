This is the companion repo of the book <a href="https://www.essentialmathfordatascience.com/">Essential Math for Data Science</a>. You'll find here the datasets and the audio examples.

# Datasets

The folder `data` contains open source datasets that you'll need in this book, except audio samples for the hands-on project on PCA in chapter 10 (the instructions are given to download the files). In some case, slight modifications have been made to have data easily readable, and sometimes only a subset of the dataset has been selected.

## Wine Quality

You'll need this dataset in Chapter 02.

It comes from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality). You can also refer to the related paper: Cortez, Paulo, et al. "Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties." Decision Support Systems 47.4 (2009): 547-553.

## COVID19

You'll need this dataset in Chapter 06.

This dataset shows the number of cases of COVID-19 in different area of France in March 2020. It comes from [here](https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/cas-confirmes-dinfection-au-covid-19-par-region/).

## CIQUAL

You'll need this dataset in Chapter 09.

This dataset comes from the [French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety](https://ciqual.anses.fr) and presents food composition data.

## Beer Consumption

You'll need this dataset in Chapter 10.

It shows the relationship between beer consumption and temperature in São Paulo, Brazil for the year 2015footnote:[https://www.kaggle.com/dongeorge/beer-consumption-sao-paulo].

## Audio Categorization

You'll need this dataset in Chapter 10.

This dataset is composed of 1500 5-s audio samples. It has been released as a machine learning challenge in 2018 with the goal to categorize audio samples. You can find more details it [here](https://cvssp.org/projects/making_sense_of_sounds/site/challenge/). This dataset is not included in the repository, you need to get it [here](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/12610922).


# Audio Examples

You'll find here the audio resulting of the Hands-on project on Principal Component Analysis.
